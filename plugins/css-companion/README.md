# CSS Companion - Usage

> Write custom CSS using your editor of choice.

## Sync a file

Before synchronizing an external CSS file, make sure to save your current theme's CSS if haven't done so already.

1. Go to `File -> Preferences -> CSS Companion...`
2. Click on the grey input box "Watch file", it will prompt you to select a file
3. Tick `Watching`
4. You're done! Changes you make to the synced file will apply to Blockbench in real-time (every time the file is saved)

⚠️ Changes you make inside Blockbench builtin CSS editor will be overwritten whenever the synced file updates.
It is wise (and the point of the plugin, too) not to use the builtin editor when file changes watching is enabled.

## Additional information

If you leave `Watching` enabled and close Blockbench, CSS synchronization will continue next time.
