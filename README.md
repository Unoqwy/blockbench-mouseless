# blockbench-mouseless

Stage: Not really started yet. The README will be updated when the project reaches a "kind of useful" state.

## Installation

A bundled version of the plugin is automatically deployed on the [dist](https://github.com/Unoqwy/blockbench-mouseless/tree/dist) branch.
To install the plugin, you can therefore go to `Plugins -> Load Plugin from URL` and paste [this link](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Unoqwy/blockbench-mouseless@dist/mouseless.js).
